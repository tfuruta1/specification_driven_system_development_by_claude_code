# Hello World Project

A simple Python application that demonstrates basic output functionality and follows TDD (Test-Driven Development) principles.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project provides a minimal "Hello World" implementation in Python, created using SDD+TDD methodology. It serves as a foundation for Python development practices and demonstrates proper code structure, testing, and documentation.

## 🚀 Features

- Simple "Hello World" output
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean code with docstrings and type hints
- TDD-compliant implementation
